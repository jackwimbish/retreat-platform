### üîÑ Next Steps
1. Create sample content for testing
2. Customize Volto UI for Issue and Participant management
3. Begin implementing the six core features:
   - Full Issue-Tracking System (building on Issue content type)
   - Participant Directory & Profiles (building on Participant content type)
   - Resource Booking System
   - Real-Time Notifications
   - Custom Analytics Dashboard
   - Third-Party Calendar Integration

### üìù Technical Notes
- **Frontend Access**: Use http://localhost:3000 (Volto)
- **Backend Access**: Limited UI at http://localhost:8080/Plone (Volto breaks classic theme)
- **API Endpoint**: http://localhost:8080/Plone/++api++/
- **Content Management**: Add content via Volto UI "+" button
- **Development Pattern**: Local Plone instance with programmatic setup for reproducibility
